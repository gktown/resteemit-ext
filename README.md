# Resteemit
#### A Curation Webtool and Google Extension.
Resteemit.com is a curation tool and mass curation experiment. Curators can use the web-based curation tool Resteemit.com to upvote and resteem articles to the feed, located on @resteemable. Users can [join the resteemable curation trail](streemian.com/profile/curationtrail/trailing/943) to gain curation rewards on posts that come through.<br>
